Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**asFile** | **String** | asFile indicates that the provided binary input should be considered a single file within the build input. For example, specifying \&quot;webapp.war\&quot; would place the provided binary as &#x60;/webapp.war&#x60; for the builder. If left empty, the Docker and Source build strategies assume this file is a zip, tar, or tar.gz file and extract it as the source. The custom strategy receives this binary as standard input. This filename may not contain slashes or be &#39;..&#39; or &#39;.&#39;. |  [optional]
